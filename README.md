# NYC-TAXI-TRIP-DATA-ANALYTICS
## Overview
In the metropolitan city of New York, Taxi or cab rides play a major and crucial role in ferrying millions of people across the city to their destinations everyday. These rides include Yellow Taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans and paratransit vans. The New York TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) is responsible for regulating and licensing of cabs for such a large scale transit operation. As a part of its operations, TLC collects, maintains and publishes trip details records of all of its above mentioned Taxi operations. This includes details such as pick-up and drop-off date, time and locations, number of passengers, fare for trips etc. These data points can provide useful insights which can aide the New York TLC in improving their operational efficiency and help them understand passenger and traffic trends. However, analyzing these data by conventional data processing means is not feasible simply due to the volume of the data. The number of Yellow Taxi Trips alone in the month of  Jan’2020 produced 6 million rows worth of data. Considering the trips from all other cab types, over months or even years (first publicly available record from TLC is from 2009), shall push the data volume far beyond the scope of conventional data analytics tools such as Excel. Hence, in our project we shall aim at leveraging Big Data Technologies and Tools to perform exploratory data analytics to derive  useful insights such as Peak Traffic Hour Trend on Weekdays and Weekends, most congested areas classified by time/day, average number of rides on any given day, top most in demand routes etc.
